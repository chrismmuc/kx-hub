Analyze the relationship between these two knowledge chunks from my personal knowledge base.

## Chunk A: {source_title}
{source_summary}

## Chunk B: {target_title}
{target_summary}

## Task
Determine if there is a meaningful semantic relationship between these chunks.

## Relationship Types
Choose ONE of these relationship types:
- **relates_to**: General thematic connection (similar topics, concepts, or domains)
- **extends**: Chunk B builds upon, develops, or evolves the ideas in Chunk A
- **supports**: Chunk B provides evidence, examples, or confirmation for Chunk A
- **contradicts**: Chunk B conflicts with, challenges, or presents an opposing view to Chunk A
- **applies_to**: Chunk B describes a practical application or implementation of concepts from Chunk A
- **none**: No meaningful relationship exists between these chunks

## Response Format
Return ONLY a JSON object with these fields:
- "type": One of the relationship types above
- "confidence": Your confidence in this relationship (0.0 to 1.0)
- "explanation": Brief explanation (1-2 sentences) of why this relationship exists

Example response:
{"type": "extends", "confidence": 0.85, "explanation": "Chunk B elaborates on the productivity framework introduced in Chunk A with specific implementation strategies."}

Important:
- Only identify relationships with confidence >= 0.5
- If no clear relationship exists, return type "none"
- Focus on conceptual/semantic relationships, not surface-level keyword matches
