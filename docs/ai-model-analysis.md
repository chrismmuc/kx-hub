## Multi-Provider Architecture Strategy

### Where to Add Provider Flexibility

#### ❌ Embeddings: NOT Worth Multi-Provider Support
**Reason:**
- Anthropic doesn't offer embeddings
- Switching embedding models breaks similarity comparisons (vector spaces incompatible)
- Adding Voyage AI adds complexity with minimal benefit
- Cost is already negligible ($0.02/M tokens)

**Recommendation:** Standardize on OpenAI text-embedding-3-small

#### ✅ Text Generation: HIGH Value for Multi-Provider

**Benefits:**
1. **Performance comparison:** Test which model generates better summaries/connections
2. **Cost optimization:** Switch models based on task complexity
3. **Resilience:** Fallback if one provider has outage
4. **Feature access:** Use Claude for coding tasks, GPT for multimodal

**Architecture Extension Points:**

1. **Configuration Layer** (`/config/settings.yml`):
```yaml
ai_providers:
  embeddings:
    provider: openai
    model: text-embedding-3-small

  summaries:
    primary_provider: anthropic
    primary_model: claude-haiku-4.5
    fallback_provider: openai
    fallback_model: gpt-5-mini

  synthesis:
    primary_provider: anthropic
    primary_model: claude-sonnet-4.5
    fallback_provider: openai
    fallback_model: gpt-5

  query_understanding:
    provider: openai
    model: gpt-5-mini
    # User can switch to anthropic/claude-haiku-4.5 for testing
```

2. **Code Abstraction** (create provider interface):
```
/src/services/ai/
├── base_provider.py         # Abstract interface
├── openai_provider.py       # OpenAI implementation
├── anthropic_provider.py    # Anthropic implementation
└── provider_factory.py      # Returns provider based on config
```

3. **Lambda Functions to Update:**
- `Lambda Summaries & Synthesis` (L5): Add provider switching logic
- `Lambda Query` (new): Support provider configuration
- Keep embeddings Lambda (L3) OpenAI-only

4. **Secrets Manager:**
```
/kx-hub/ai-providers/openai-api-key
/kx-hub/ai-providers/anthropic-api-key
```

### Implementation Phases

**Phase 1: Single Provider (MVP)**
- OpenAI for embeddings (required)
- Choose ONE provider for text generation (recommend Anthropic Haiku 4.5)
- Simplest path to launch

**Phase 2: Multi-Provider Support**
- Add provider abstraction layer
- Implement config-driven provider selection
- Add Anthropic + OpenAI support

**Phase 3: Intelligent Routing**
- Automatic model selection based on task complexity
- Cost optimization logic
- Fallback handling

## Performance Considerations

### Model Quality for Your Use Cases

**Summarization:**
- Both GPT-5-mini and Claude Haiku 4.5 excel at this
- Research shows smaller models often outperform larger ones for straightforward summarization
- Source-aware prompting more important than model choice

**Creative Connections:**
- Claude Sonnet 4.5 likely superior for contrastive pairing
- Strong reasoning and pattern recognition capabilities
- GPT-5 strong alternative, worth A/B testing

**Semantic Search:**
- OpenAI embeddings proven for RAG/similarity applications
- text-embedding-3-small sufficient unless precision issues observed

### Speed Considerations

**Haiku 4.5:** 2x faster than Sonnet 4.5 → better for real-time query responses
**GPT-5-nano:** Fastest, cheapest → consider for high-frequency queries
**Batch Processing:** Use for non-time-sensitive tasks (daily ingestion, weekly synthesis)

---

## Final Recommendations

### Recommended MVP Configuration

```yaml
embeddings: openai/text-embedding-3-small          # $0.02/M tokens
summaries: anthropic/claude-haiku-4.5               # $1/$5/M tokens
synthesis: anthropic/claude-sonnet-4.5              # $3/$15/M tokens
queries: openai/gpt-5-mini                          # $0.25/$2/M tokens
```

**Total estimated cost: $2.29/month for typical usage**

### Multi-Provider Roadmap

1. **MVP:** Single provider (Anthropic for text, OpenAI for embeddings)
2. **Phase 2:** Add multi-provider support with config-driven selection
3. **Phase 3:** Enable user A/B testing and performance comparison
4. **Future:** Intelligent routing based on task complexity and cost optimization

### Where Multi-Provider Adds Value

✅ **High Value:**
- Summaries & Knowledge Cards (high volume, cost-sensitive)
- Creative Synthesis (quality-critical, worth testing)
- Query understanding (user-facing, performance-critical)

❌ **Low Value:**
- Embeddings (Anthropic doesn't offer, switching breaks compatibility)
