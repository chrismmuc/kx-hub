# 8. Future Features & Backlog

This section captures potential features and enhancements for future iterations beyond the MVP.

## Post-MVP Feature Ideas

### 8.1 Additional Data Sources

#### 8.1.1 DayOne Journal Import
**Status:** Idea
**Priority:** Medium
**Complexity:** Medium

**Description:**
Import personal journal entries from the DayOne app to include in the knowledge base alongside Readwise highlights.

**Technical Approach:**
- DayOne has no public API
- Implementation via **local file upload**:
  - User exports DayOne journal as JSON (DayOne supports JSON export)
  - Upload JSON file to Cloud Storage bucket (e.g., `gs://kx-hub-uploads/dayone/`)
  - Cloud Function triggered on file upload
  - Parse DayOne JSON format and normalize to standard markdown
  - Store in `gs://kx-hub-markdown-normalized/journal/{id}.md`
  - Process through existing embedding pipeline

**Frontmatter Schema for Journal Entries:**
```yaml
---
id: "dayone-{uuid}"
title: "Journal Entry - {date}"
source: "dayone"
type: "journal"
created_at: "{timestamp}"
updated_at: "{timestamp}"
tags: ["journal", "{mood}", "{location}"]
location: "{lat},{lng}" (if available)
weather: "{weather}" (if available)
photos: ["photo1.jpg", "photo2.jpg"] (if available)
entry_count: 1
---
```

**Considerations:**
- Privacy: Journal entries are highly personal - ensure proper access controls
- Photo handling: DayOne entries may include photos - decide if/how to store
- Deduplication: Prevent duplicate imports
- Date range selection: Allow users to select which date ranges to import
- Incremental updates: Support importing new entries without re-uploading everything

**Dependencies:**
- Story 1.2 (normalization pipeline) ✅ Complete
- Story 1.3 (embedding & storage) - Future

**Estimated Effort:** 2-3 days

### 8.2 Intelligent Content Discovery

#### 8.2.1 Current Article Recommendations & Follow-ups
**Status:** Idea
**Priority:** High
**Complexity:** High

**Description:**
Proactively search for and propose current articles that build upon or follow up on existing knowledge base content. Combine with cross-topic detection to discover interesting connections and validate what's already available.

**Key Capabilities:**

1. **Follow-up Detection:**
   - Analyze existing highlights/articles to identify key topics, authors, concepts
   - Use web search APIs (Google Custom Search API, Bing Search API) to find recent articles
   - Filter for articles published after the original highlight date
   - Rank by relevance and novelty

2. **Cross-Topic Connection Discovery:**
   - Use semantic embeddings to find unexpected connections between clusters
   - Example: "This article about urban planning mentions concepts from your behavioral psychology cluster"
   - Surface articles that bridge multiple existing clusters

3. **Knowledge Gap Analysis:**
   - Identify topics with many questions but few answers
   - Suggest articles that fill these gaps
   - Example: "You have 10 highlights questioning X, here are 3 recent articles explaining X"

4. **Validation & Verification:**
   - Check if recommended content already exists in knowledge base
   - Detect near-duplicates (same article from different sources)
   - Flag contradictions or updates to outdated information

**Technical Approach:**

```
1. Scheduled Job (weekly):
   ↓
2. Extract key entities/topics from recent highlights
   ↓
3. Generate search queries (Gemini LLM)
   ↓
4. Web Search API calls (Google Custom Search)
   ↓
5. Candidate article URLs
   ↓
6. Fetch article content (web scraping/API)
   ↓
7. Embed article snippets (Vertex AI)
   ↓
8. Semantic similarity matching
   ↓
9. Rank by: relevance, recency, novelty, cross-cluster connections
   ↓
10. Store recommendations in Firestore
    ↓
11. Present in weekly digest email OR query interface
```

**Data Model Extensions:**

**Firestore `kb_recommendations` collection:**
```javascript
{
  recommendation_id: "rec-{uuid}",
  type: "follow_up" | "cross_topic" | "gap_fill" | "update",
  title: "Article title",
  url: "https://...",
  source: "google_search" | "twitter" | "reddit",
  published_date: "2024-10-19",
  related_items: ["item-123", "item-456"], // IDs from kb_items
  related_clusters: ["cluster-ai", "cluster-psychology"],
  connection_explanation: "This article discusses...", // Generated by LLM
  similarity_score: 0.87,
  novelty_score: 0.92,
  status: "pending" | "accepted" | "rejected" | "saved",
  created_at: "2024-10-19T10:00:00Z"
}
```

**Configuration (`config/settings.yml`):**
```yaml
content_discovery:
  enabled: true
  schedule: "0 9 * * SUN"  # Weekly on Sunday 9am
  max_recommendations_per_week: 10
  min_similarity_score: 0.75
  search_apis:
    - provider: "google_custom_search"
      api_key_secret: "/kx-hub/google-search/api-key"
      cx: "your-search-engine-id"
      max_results: 20
  lookback_days: 30  # Only process highlights from last 30 days
  cross_cluster_threshold: 0.70  # Similarity threshold for cross-cluster connections
```

**User Experience:**

1. **Weekly Digest Section:**
   ```
   ## 📚 Recommended Reading

   ### Follow-ups to Your Highlights
   - "The Future of AI Regulation (2024)" - Builds on your highlights from "AI Ethics"
   - "New Research on Sleep Quality" - Updates your notes from "Why We Sleep"

   ### Interesting Connections
   - "Urban Design for Mental Health" - Bridges your clusters: Architecture + Psychology
   ```

2. **Query Interface:**
   ```
   > query "AI regulation"

   Results:
   1. [Your highlights] Article: "AI Ethics Principles" (2023)
   2. [Recommended] "The Future of AI Regulation" (2024) ⭐ NEW
      → Builds on your existing highlights, published 6 months later
   ```

3. **Push to Readwise Reader:**
   - Automatically add recommended articles to Readwise Reader queue
   - Use Readwise Reader API to save URLs
   - Tag recommendations with: `kx-hub-recommended`, `follow-up`, or `cross-topic`
   - Batch save to avoid API rate limits
   - User can read/highlight in Reader, which feeds back into the pipeline

**Readwise Reader API Integration:**

The recommendations can be pushed directly to your Readwise Reader queue, creating a closed-loop system where:
1. You highlight articles in Reader
2. System finds follow-up articles
3. System pushes recommendations back to Reader
4. You read and highlight recommended articles
5. Cycle continues with deeper knowledge building

**API Configuration:**
```yaml
readwise_reader:
  api_key_secret: "/kx-hub/readwise-reader/api-key"
  auto_push_recommendations: true
  max_push_per_week: 10
  tags: ["kx-hub-recommended"]
```

**Reader API Endpoint:**
```
POST https://readwise.io/api/v3/save/
Headers:
  Authorization: Token {api_key}
Body:
  {
    "url": "https://article-url.com",
    "tags": ["kx-hub-recommended", "follow-up"],
    "category": "article",
    "location": "new"  // Adds to "New" section
  }
```

**Flow:**
```
Weekly Discovery Job
    ↓
Generate Recommendations
    ↓
Store in Firestore (kb_recommendations)
    ↓
[Optional] Push to Readwise Reader API
    ↓
User reads in Reader app
    ↓
User highlights → Readwise API
    ↓
Daily Ingest picks up highlights
    ↓
Cycle continues
```

This creates a **self-reinforcing knowledge loop** where the system actively feeds you relevant content in your existing reading workflow.

**API Costs Estimate:**
- Google Custom Search API: $5/1000 queries, ~100 queries/week = ~$2/month
- Article content fetching: Web scraping (free) or diffbot.com API ($0.25/1000 pages)
- LLM for query generation + explanations: ~500 tokens/week × $0.075/1M tokens = negligible

**Total Additional Cost:** ~$2-3/month

**Considerations:**
- **Rate Limiting:** Web search APIs have daily quotas
- **Content Quality:** Filter out low-quality content (clickbait, paywalls)
- **User Feedback Loop:** Allow users to mark recommendations as helpful/not helpful
- **Privacy:** Don't send personal journal entries to external search APIs
- **Deduplication:** Complex - same article may have multiple URLs
- **Freshness vs Relevance:** Balance between very recent and highly relevant

**Dependencies:**
- Story 1.3 (embedding & vector search) - Future
- Story for clustering & linking - Future
- Email digest infrastructure - Future

**Estimated Effort:** 5-7 days (MVP), 10-15 days (full feature)

**Future Enhancements:**
- Integration with Twitter/X API for thread recommendations
- Reddit integration (relevant subreddit discussions)
- ArXiv integration for academic papers
- YouTube video recommendations (with transcripts)
- Podcast episode recommendations (via podcast search APIs)
- Real-time notifications for high-priority recommendations
