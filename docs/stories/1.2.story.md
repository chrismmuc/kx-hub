# Story: Transform Raw JSON to Normalized Markdown

As a **system operator**, I want the **raw Readwise JSON data to be automatically transformed into normalized Markdown files with frontmatter**, so that **the data is in a consistent, readable format ready for embedding and vector search**.

## Acceptance Criteria

1. The system must trigger a Cloud Workflow when the daily ingest completes (via Pub/Sub topic `daily-ingest`)
2. The Cloud Workflow must orchestrate a normalization Cloud Function
3. The normalization function must read all JSON files from the `kx-hub-raw-json` bucket
4. For each JSON file (book/article), the function must:
   - Extract title, author, source, highlights, and metadata
   - Generate Markdown content with YAML frontmatter
   - Include all highlights as Markdown blockquotes or list items
   - Preserve unique identifiers and timestamps
5. The normalized Markdown files must be saved to a `kx-hub-markdown-normalized` bucket with naming pattern `/notes/{item_id}.md`
6. The frontmatter must include: `id`, `title`, `author`, `source`, `url` (if available), `created_at`, `updated_at`, `tags` (if any), `highlight_count`
7. The workflow must handle errors gracefully and log progress to Cloud Logging
8. Upon successful completion, the workflow should continue to the next pipeline step (embedding)

## Dev Notes

### System Architecture Context

This is **Step 2** of the Batch Processing Pipeline. [Source: architecture/data-flow-details.md, architecture/system-architecture.md]

**Pipeline Flow:**
```
Step 1 (✅ Story 1.1): Ingest → GCS raw-json → Pub/Sub "daily-ingest"
Step 2 (THIS STORY): Pub/Sub → Cloud Workflow → F2: Normalize → GCS markdown-normalized
Step 3 (Future): Workflow → F3: Embed & Store → Vector Search + Firestore
```

**Trigger Mechanism:**
- Pub/Sub topic `daily-ingest` (published by Story 1.1's ingest function)
- Cloud Workflows listens to this topic and orchestrates the pipeline

**Components to Build:**
1. **Cloud Workflow Definition** (`terraform/workflows/batch-pipeline.yaml`)
   - Subscribe to Pub/Sub topic `daily-ingest`
   - Call Cloud Function F2: Normalize
   - Handle errors and retries
   - Pass execution to next step (placeholder for Story 1.3)

2. **Cloud Function F2: Normalize/Markdown** (`src/normalize/main.py`)
   - Triggered by Cloud Workflow
   - Reads from `gs://kx-hub-raw-json/*.json`
   - Transforms to Markdown with frontmatter
   - Writes to `gs://kx-hub-markdown-normalized/notes/{id}.md`

### Data Model Context

[Source: prd/5-data-model-brief.md]

**Cloud Storage Structure:**
- Input: `/raw/*.json` (from Story 1.1)
- Output: `/markdown/notes/{id}.md` (THIS STORY creates these)

**Markdown Format Example:**
```markdown
---
id: "51822710"
title: "Book Title or Article Headline"
author: "Author Name"
source: "kindle" | "reader" | "twitter" | "podcast"
url: "https://..." (if available)
created_at: "2024-01-15T10:30:00Z"
updated_at: "2024-10-18T20:00:00Z"
tags: ["tag1", "tag2"] (if any)
highlight_count: 25
user_book_id: 51822710
---

# Book Title or Article Headline

**Author:** Author Name
**Source:** Kindle

## Highlights

> Highlight text here
> - Note: User note if available
> - Page: 42 (if available)

> Another highlight text
> - Location: Chapter 3

...
```

### Input Data Structure

From Story 1.1, the raw JSON files have this structure:
```json
{
  "user_book_id": 12345,
  "title": "Book/Article Title",
  "author": "Author Name",
  "source": "kindle",
  "category": "books",
  "num_highlights": 25,
  "updated": "2024-10-18T20:00:00Z",
  "highlights": [
    {
      "id": 67890,
      "text": "Highlighted passage...",
      "note": "My note",
      "location": 42,
      "location_type": "page",
      "highlighted_at": "2024-01-15T10:30:00Z",
      "url": null,
      "color": "yellow",
      "tags": [{"name": "important"}]
    }
  ]
}
```

### Previous Story Insights

[Source: Story 1.1 Dev Agent Record]

Key learnings from Story 1.1:
- Raw JSON files are stored as `readwise-book-{user_book_id}.json`
- Files include books AND articles (both captured via Readwise Export API)
- Each JSON contains complete book/article metadata plus nested highlights array
- Rate limiting and retry logic already handled at ingest
- Cloud Function uses lazy GCP client initialization pattern
- Project uses structured logging (logger.info/warning/error)

### Cloud Workflow Configuration

[Source: architecture/data-flow-details.md]

- **Trigger**: Pub/Sub subscription to topic `daily-ingest`
- **Service Account**: Needs permissions to:
  - Read from GCS bucket `kx-hub-raw-json`
  - Write to GCS bucket `kx-hub-markdown-normalized`
  - Invoke Cloud Functions
  - Write logs to Cloud Logging

### Testing Requirements

[Source: Story 1.1 testing patterns]

- Unit tests must mock:
  - GCS bucket reads (raw JSON)
  - GCS bucket writes (markdown)
  - Cloud Workflow triggers
- Test cases:
  - Valid book JSON → correct Markdown output
  - Valid article JSON → correct Markdown output
  - Missing fields → graceful degradation
  - Empty highlights array → valid output with zero highlights
  - Malformed JSON → error handling and logging
- Integration test:
  - End-to-end: Upload test JSON → trigger workflow → verify Markdown created

### File Locations

[Source: Story 1.1 project structure]

```
src/
  normalize/
    main.py          # Cloud Function handler
    transformer.py   # JSON → Markdown transformation logic
    requirements.txt # Dependencies
terraform/
  workflows/
    batch-pipeline.yaml  # Cloud Workflow definition
  main.tf              # Add normalize resources
tests/
  test_normalize.py    # Unit tests
```

### Security Considerations

[Source: architecture/security-best-practices.md]

- New Service Account: `normalize-function-sa`
- IAM Roles needed:
  - `roles/storage.objectViewer` on `kx-hub-raw-json` bucket
  - `roles/storage.objectCreator` on `kx-hub-markdown-normalized` bucket
  - `roles/logging.logWriter` for Cloud Logging

### Performance Considerations

- Batch processing: Process all files in one workflow execution
- Parallelization: Consider Cloud Tasks for parallel processing of large file sets
- Memory: Cloud Function should handle large highlight arrays (100+ highlights per book)
- Timeout: Set function timeout to 540s (9 min) to handle large batches
