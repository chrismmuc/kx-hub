# Story: Intelligent Document Chunking with Overlap

As a **knowledge base user**, I want **highlights and documents to be split into optimal-sized chunks with overlaps and contextual frontmatter**, so that **vector search returns specific, relevant passages with full content in a single query**.

## Problem Statement

Currently, the system treats each entire document (book with all highlights) as a single embedding vector. This creates several critical issues:

1. **Loss of Granularity**: A book with 200 highlights becomes one vector, making it impossible to retrieve specific passages
2. **Poor Search Relevance**: Users searching for "loss aversion" get an entire book reference instead of the specific highlight
3. **Context Window Waste**: Large documents (20KB+) exceed optimal embedding model context, degrading vector quality
4. **No Semantic Boundaries**: Highlights about completely different topics are mashed together in one vector
5. **Extra Round Trip**: Current architecture requires Firestore query + GCS fetch to retrieve content

## Acceptance Criteria

1. **Chunk Size Configuration**: Implement configurable chunk sizes (target: 512 tokens, max: 1024 tokens) that fit within `gemini-embedding-001` optimal context window (768 dimensions).

2. **Overlap Strategy**: Implement sliding window chunking with configurable overlap (target: 50-100 tokens) to preserve context across chunk boundaries and prevent information loss at split points.

3. **Frontmatter + Content Storage**: Each chunk stored in Firestore includes:
   ```yaml
   chunk_id: '41094950-chunk-003'
   parent_doc_id: '41094950'
   chunk_index: 3
   total_chunks: 25
   title: "Thinking, Fast and Slow"
   author: "Daniel Kahneman"
   source: kindle
   category: books
   tags: [psychology, behavioral-economics]
   content: "Full text of this chunk with overlap..."  # NEW: Full chunk text
   embedding: [0.1, 0.2, ..., 0.3]  # 768-dim vector
   chunk_boundaries: {start: 5120, end: 7240}
   overlap_start: 50
   overlap_end: 75
   ```

4. **Smart Boundary Detection**: Prioritize splitting at semantic boundaries:
   - Between highlights (primary boundary)
   - Between paragraphs (secondary)
   - Between sentences (tertiary)
   - Token limit (fallback)

5. **Single-Query Retrieval**: Vector search returns complete chunk content without requiring secondary GCS fetch - all data in one Firestore document.

6. **Pipeline Integration**: Update the normalize and embed stages to:
   - Split all documents into chunks (no size threshold check)
   - Generate chunks with overlaps
   - Create individual embeddings for each chunk
   - Store full chunk content in Firestore alongside embedding
   - Maintain manifest tracking for chunk processing

7. **Cost & Performance**: Ensure chunking strategy keeps total costs under $2/month (estimated +$0.40/month for 5× more embeddings, offset by eliminating GCS retrieval round trips).

## Dev Notes

- **Architecture Context**
  - Embedding model: `gemini-embedding-001` via Vertex AI (~768-dim vectors)
  - Current approach: One document = one embedding [Source: src/embed/main.py:502-504]
  - Storage: Firestore `kb_items` collection with vector index
  - Current cost: ~$0.90/month total system
  - **Breaking Change**: This story will require wiping existing `kb_items` and `pipeline_items` data

- **Cost Impact Analysis**
  - Current: 271 books × 1 embedding = 271 embeddings (~$0.10/month)
  - Proposed: 271 books × 5 chunks avg = 1,350 embeddings (~$0.50/month)
  - **Embedding cost increase**: +$0.40/month
  - **Firestore storage increase**: +$0.05/month (storing ~1.35MB chunk content)
  - **GCS read savings**: -$0.05/month (no secondary fetch needed)
  - **Net impact**: +$0.40/month total (+31% system cost, from $0.90 → $1.30/month)
  - **Trade-off**: Excellent - pay 40¢ more for better search + faster retrieval

- **Retrieval Performance Improvement**
  - **Before**: Search → Firestore (embedding match) → GCS (fetch markdown) = 2 round trips
  - **After**: Search → Firestore (embedding + content) = 1 round trip
  - **Benefit**: Faster response times, simpler code, better user experience

- **Current Implementation Issues**
  - Transformer combines all highlights into single markdown [Source: src/normalize/transformer.py:72-112]
  - Embed stage treats entire markdown as one text blob [Source: src/embed/main.py:502-504]
  - No chunking logic exists in codebase currently

- **Technical Approach - Chunk at Normalize Stage**:
  - Split documents into chunks during markdown generation
  - Create multiple markdown files: `{user_book_id}-chunk-{index}.md`
  - Each chunk flows through existing embed pipeline as separate item
  - Embed stage stores full chunk content + embedding in Firestore
  - Pros: Cleaner separation, reuses existing pipeline, easier testing
  - No backward compatibility needed - fresh start

- **Token Counting**
  - Use `tiktoken` library (OpenAI tokenizer) as approximation for Gemini tokens
  - Target: 512 tokens per chunk (~2048 characters with 0.25 char/token ratio)
  - Max: 1024 tokens per chunk (~4096 characters)
  - Overlap: 50-100 tokens (~200-400 characters)

- **Semantic Boundary Detection**
  - Highlights are already delimited by `>` blockquotes in markdown
  - Paragraph boundaries: `\n\n`
  - Sentence boundaries: `. ` followed by uppercase letter
  - Fallback: Hard split at token limit with overlap

- **Frontmatter Handling**
  - Parse original YAML frontmatter from document
  - Generate chunk-specific frontmatter with parent context
  - Keep essential fields: `title`, `author`, `source`, `category`, `tags`
  - Add chunk fields: `doc_id`, `chunk_id`, `chunk_index`, `total_chunks`

- **Schema Design**
  - New `kb_items` collection structure:
    - `chunk_id` (primary key): Unique identifier for this chunk
    - `parent_doc_id`: Reference to original document
    - `chunk_index`: Position in sequence (0-based)
    - `total_chunks`: Total chunks from parent document
    - `title`, `author`, `source`, `category`, `tags`: From parent document
    - **`content`**: Full chunk text content (NEW - eliminates GCS fetch)
    - `embedding`: 768-dim vector
    - `embedding_status`: Processing status
    - `chunk_boundaries`: { start: int, end: int }
    - `overlap_start`, `overlap_end`: Overlap character counts
    - `created_at`, `updated_at`: Timestamps
  - Index on `chunk_id`, `parent_doc_id`, and `embedding` (vector index)

- **Manifest & Pipeline Updates**
  - Manifest must track chunks separately: `{user_book_id}-chunk-{index}`
  - Update `pipeline_items` to handle chunk-level status tracking
  - Embed stage must recognize chunk items and process independently

- **Testing Requirements**
  - Unit tests for chunking logic:
    - Token counting accuracy
    - Overlap calculation
    - Boundary detection (highlight, paragraph, sentence)
    - Frontmatter injection
    - Content extraction and storage
  - Integration tests:
    - End-to-end pipeline with chunked documents
    - Firestore writes with chunk metadata + content
    - Vector search returning chunk results with full content
  - Test fixtures:
    - Small document (1 chunk)
    - Medium document (3-5 chunks)
    - Large document (20+ chunks)

- **Configuration**
  - Add to `docs/prd/6-configuration.md`:
    - `CHUNK_TARGET_TOKENS`: 512 (default)
    - `CHUNK_MAX_TOKENS`: 1024 (default)
    - `CHUNK_OVERLAP_TOKENS`: 75 (default)
    - `CHUNK_MIN_SIZE_TOKENS`: 100 (minimum viable chunk)

- **Data Migration**
  - Clear existing Firestore collections: `kb_items`, `pipeline_items`
  - Clear GCS bucket: `gs://kx-hub-markdown-normalized/`
  - Re-run full pipeline from scratch with chunking enabled
  - No migration script needed - clean slate approach

**Dependencies:** Story 1.5 (gRPC upsert) must be complete and stable. This story introduces significant pipeline changes and requires a complete data wipe.

**Estimated Complexity:** High — involves changes to normalize, embed, schema, and introduces new chunking subsystem. Breaking change requires full data re-ingestion.

**Success Metrics:**
- Search returns passage-level results with full content (not document references)
- Average chunk size: 400-600 tokens
- Overlap coverage: 50-100 tokens between adjacent chunks
- Total system cost: <$2/month (target: $1.30/month)
- Retrieval latency: <100ms (single Firestore query, no GCS fetch)
- Search relevance improvement: measured via user feedback or click-through rate

**Cost Summary:**
- Current: $0.90/month total system
- Proposed: $1.30/month total system (+$0.40/month, +44%)
- **ROI**: Better search quality + faster retrieval + simpler architecture for 40¢/month

### Known Limitations & Future Improvements

1. **Overlap Strategy**: Current 75-token fixed overlap; could explore dynamic overlap based on semantic boundaries
2. **Chunk Quality**: No feedback mechanism to adjust chunk sizes based on search quality (future: user feedback loop)
3. **Semantic Detection**: Highlight detection relies on markdown `>` syntax; could improve with NLP boundary detection
4. **Batch Processing**: Embed stage processes chunks sequentially; could parallelize for large batches
5. **Monitoring**: Basic cost tracking; could add more granular metrics (chunk quality, search relevance)

### QA Recommendations

**For Production Monitoring:**
1. Track actual embedding API costs vs projected ($0.40/month vs actual)
2. Monitor chunk boundary quality via user search feedback
3. Alert if any chunk fails embedding (currently all succeed, but preventive)
4. Track Firestore read/write latency for retrieval performance

**For Future Enhancements:**
1. Implement dynamic overlap based on content density
2. Add chunk quality scoring (relevance, informativeness)
3. Implement A/B testing for different chunk sizes (512 vs 768 vs 1024)
4. Consider multi-level chunking (document → section → chunk) for very large documents

### Conclusion
