- Contradictions highlighted as most valuable for article angles
- Claude generates ideas in conversation, not stored

|-------|-------------|--------|
| 12.1 | **Cloud Scheduler Setup** - Schedule weekly batch job at Friday 04:00 UTC (customizable via config) | ✅ Done |
| 12.2 | **Batch Recommendations Function** - Cloud Function executes `recommendations()` with balanced mode, max 3 results, high recency filter | ✅ Done |
| 12.3 | **Readwise Reader Integration** - Implement `POST /api/v3/save/` to add recommendations to Reader inbox (advance Story 3.7) | ✅ Done |
| 12.4 | **Auto-Tagging** - Automatically tag saved articles with `ai-recommended` + source name + topic tags | ✅ Done |
| 12.5 | **Deduplication Check** - Skip articles already in Reader library (query `/api/v3/list/` before saving) | ✅ Done |
| 12.6 | **Batch Job Tracking** - Store batch execution metadata (timestamp, result count, success/failure) in Firestore `batch_jobs` collection | ✅ Done |
| 12.7 | **Error Handling & Alerts** - Retry logic, Slack notifications on failure, detailed logging | ✅ Done |

**Key Features:**

- Weekly digest: Saves execution report to Firestore

**Integration Points:**
- Extends Epic 11 (Problem-Driven Recommendations)
- Completes Story 3.7 (Save to Reader)
- Uses Cloud Scheduler + Cloud Functions
- Firestore for job tracking
- Readwise Reader API (new)

**Config Storage** (Firestore `config/batch_recommendations`):
```json
{
  "enabled": true,
  "schedule": "0 22 * * 4",  # Thursday 22:00 UTC
  "mode": "balanced",
  "max_results": 3,
  "recency_days": 7,
  "auto_tags": ["ai-recommended"],
  "readwise_api_enabled": true,
  "notification_slack": "#ai-recs"
}
```

**Cost Impact:**
- Cloud Scheduler: ~$0 (included in free tier)
- Cloud Function (weekly): ~$0.50/month
- Readwise API calls: Included in paid plan

**Success Metrics:**
- 100% scheduled execution (no missed runs)

| 13.1 | **Reader API Client** - Fetch docs tagged `kx-auto-ingest` with full text from Reader API v3 | ✅ Done |
| 13.2 | **KB-Aware Two-Stage Snippet Extraction** - LLM extracts candidates, KB enrichment for novelty + problem relevance, LLM judge selects best | ✅ Done |
| 13.3 | **Pipeline Integration** - Snippets → normalize → embed → Firestore as `kb_items` | Planned |
| 13.4 | **Nightly Trigger & Tag Management** - Cloud Scheduler, remove tag after processing | Planned |

**Key Design:** No new MCP tools or collections. Snippets are regular `kb_items` with `source_type: "auto-snippet"`, searchable via existing `search_kb`.
