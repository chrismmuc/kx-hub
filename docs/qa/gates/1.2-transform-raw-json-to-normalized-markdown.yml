# Deductions: -3 for test scenario gaps, -2 for missing markdown format spec

evidence:
  story_quality: 'EXCELLENT'
  requirements_clarity: 'All 8 ACs clear, measurable, testable'
  architecture_alignment: 'Strong - Step 2 in pipeline well-defined'
  testability: 'Comprehensive test strategy with minor gaps noted'

  test_scenarios_planned:
    covered:
      - 'Valid book JSON → Markdown'
      - 'Valid article JSON → Markdown'
      - 'Missing fields → graceful degradation'
      - 'Empty highlights → zero highlights output'
      - 'Malformed JSON → error handling'
      - 'GCS failures → retry logic'
    gaps:
      - 'Large highlight arrays (100+ highlights per book)'
      - 'Unicode/special characters in text'
      - 'Concurrent processing with Cloud Tasks'

nfr_validation:
  security:
    status: PASS
    notes: 'Dedicated service account with minimal permissions. No secrets required. Proper IAM scoping.'
  performance:
    status: CONCERNS
    notes: 'Timeout and memory documented (540s, large arrays), but no load testing planned. Recommend monitoring initial production runs.'
  reliability:
    status: PASS
    notes: 'Error handling, retry logic, and logging all planned. Cloud Workflow orchestration adds resilience.'
  maintainability:
    status: PASS
    notes: 'Excellent documentation. Clear separation of concerns (transformer.py). Follows Story 1.1 patterns.'

risk_summary:

  high_risks:
    - area: 'Cloud Workflow syntax complexity'
      probability: 'Medium'
      impact: 'High'
      score: 6
      mitigation: 'Start with simple workflow, comprehensive testing, incremental complexity'
  medium_risks:
    - area: 'Large batch timeout (>1000 books)'
      probability: 'Medium'
      impact: 'Medium'
      score: 4
      mitigation: 'Implement Cloud Tasks for parallelization as documented'

recommendations:
  immediate:
    - action: 'Add test scenarios for large highlight arrays (100+)'
      refs: ['tests/test_normalize.py']
      rationale: 'Performance note mentions this, but no explicit test case'
    - action: 'Add test scenario for Unicode/special characters'
      refs: ['tests/test_normalize.py']
      rationale: 'Markdown escaping edge cases (quotes, emojis, backticks)'
    - action: 'Validate Cloud Workflow syntax early'
      refs: ['terraform/workflows/batch-pipeline.yaml']
      rationale: 'Highest risk area - test workflow separately before integration'

  future:
    - action: 'Create markdown-format-spec.md documentation'
      refs: ['docs/architecture/']
      rationale: 'Useful reference for future stories consuming markdown'
    - action: 'Monitor production batch performance'
      refs: ['Cloud Logging']
      rationale: 'Validate 540s timeout is sufficient for real data volume'
    - action: 'Consider Cloud Tasks parallelization'
      refs: ['src/normalize/']
      rationale: 'If batches exceed 500 books, parallel processing will be needed'

# Post-implementation checklist (for Dev Agent and QA)
implementation_validation:
  required_for_pass:
    - 'All 8 ACs validated with tests'
    - 'Cloud Workflow triggers on Pub/Sub message'
    - 'JSON → Markdown transformation correct'
    - 'Frontmatter YAML valid and complete'
    - 'Error handling tested (malformed JSON, GCS failures)'
    - 'Integration test: end-to-end pipeline works'
    - 'All unit tests passing'
    - 'Markdown files readable and well-formatted'

  concerns_threshold:
    - 'Any test failing'
    - 'Timeout issues with moderate batches (<500 books)'
    - 'Data loss or corruption in transformation'
    - 'Workflow orchestration errors'

  fail_threshold:
    - 'Pipeline doesn't trigger'
    - 'Data loss or silent failures'
    - 'No error handling for malformed input'
    - 'Security issues (permissions too broad)'

notes: |
  This is a pre-implementation assessment. The story is exceptionally well-prepared with:
  - Complete data model examples (input JSON + output Markdown)
  - Strong architecture alignment (Step 2 in pipeline)
  - Comprehensive Dev Notes with Story 1.1 insights
  - Clear testing strategy
  - Proper security scoping

  The Dev Agent has everything needed to implement successfully. Minor test scenario gaps
  noted but not blocking. Recommend test-first approach and incremental Cloud Workflow
  complexity.

  Gate will be updated to PASS/CONCERNS/FAIL after implementation and code review.
