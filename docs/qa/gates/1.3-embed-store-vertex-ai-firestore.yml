# Deductions: -1 for Vector Search deployment time not called out, -1 for API quota limits not mentioned

evidence:
  story_quality: 'EXCELLENT'

  architecture_alignment: 'Strong - Step 3 in pipeline well-defined with integration points'
  testability: 'Comprehensive test strategy - 9 scenarios across 5 categories'

    - 'Maintains same quality bar (8 ACs, TDD approach, comprehensive docs)'
    - 'Improvement: Includes working Python code for all 3 APIs'
    - 'Excellent continuity: 6 learnings from Stories 1.1 & 1.2 documented'

  test_scenarios_planned:
    covered:
      - 'Valid markdown with complete frontmatter → embedding → Vector Search → Firestore'
      - 'Missing optional fields (url, tags) → graceful degradation'
      - 'Malformed YAML frontmatter → error logged, skip file'
      - 'Vertex AI API 429 rate limit → retry with backoff'
      - 'Vertex AI API 500 server error → retry with backoff, log error'
      - 'Vector Search upsert failure → log error, continue processing'
      - 'Firestore write failure → log error, continue processing'
      - 'Empty markdown content → embed frontmatter text only'
      - 'Very large markdown file (100+ highlights, 50KB) → API handles'
      - 'Unicode/special characters → embedding model handles'
      - 'End-to-end integration test'
    gaps:
      - 'Vertex AI quota exhaustion (daily/project quotas) - LOW PRIORITY'
      - 'Vector Search index not yet deployed scenario - LOW PRIORITY'
      - 'Partial batch failure summary reporting - MEDIUM PRIORITY'

nfr_validation:
  security:
    status: PASS
    notes: 'Least-privilege IAM model. Service-level IAM binding prevents unauthorized invocation. Follows Stories 1.1 & 1.2 patterns.'
  performance:
    status: PASS
    notes: 'Rate limiting documented (60 req/min). Batch processing strategy defined (100 datapoints/batch). Timeout appropriate (540s for 271 API calls = ~9 min). Memory allocation reasonable (512MB).'
  reliability:
    status: PASS
    notes: 'Retry logic with exponential backoff specified. Error handling for all API failure modes. Graceful degradation (log error, continue processing). Structured logging required.'
  maintainability:
    status: PASS
    notes: 'Code structure well-defined (3 files). Lazy GCP client initialization pattern. Working code examples provided. 21 subtasks provide clear roadmap.'

risk_summary:
  max_risk_score: 6
  high_risks:
    - area: 'Vertex AI Vector Search index provisioning complexity'
      probability: 'Medium (40%)'
      impact: 'High'
      score: 6
      details: 'First-time index creation requires MatchingEngineIndex + MatchingEngineIndexEndpoint + deployment. Index deployment can take 30-60 minutes on first provisioning. Terraform apply will be slow.'
      mitigation: 'Story provides Terraform resource names. Dev Agent should expect long initial deployment. RECOMMENDATION: Add note to Infrastructure task about 30-60 min deployment time.'
  medium_risks:
    - area: 'Vertex AI API rate limiting'
      probability: 'Medium (30%)'
      impact: 'Medium'
      score: 4
      details: 'Vertex AI Embeddings API: 60 requests/minute default quota. Processing 271 files = ~5 minutes minimum. API may have additional quotas (daily, per-project) not documented.'
      mitigation: 'Story includes rate limiting implementation. Retry logic with exponential backoff specified. Dev Agent should monitor for RESOURCE_EXHAUSTED errors.'
    - area: 'Firestore cold start / IAM propagation'
      probability: 'Low (20%)'
      impact: 'Medium'
      score: 3
      details: 'First Firestore API call may be slower (cold start). IAM permissions can take 60-120 seconds to propagate. Initial test run might fail with permission denied.'
      mitigation: 'Error handling with retry logic will handle this. Story includes graceful failure handling (log error, continue).'

      refs: ['docs/stories/1.3.story.md - Subtask 2.7']
      rationale: 'Validates error handling and summary reporting work correctly'

  future:
    - action: 'Monitor Vector Search index performance in production'
      refs: ['Cloud Logging']

    - action: 'Consider caching Firestore metadata for frequent queries'
      refs: ['src/embed/']
      rationale: 'If query latency becomes issue, cache hot documents in memory'

notes: |
  This is a pre-implementation assessment. The story is exceptionally well-prepared with:
  - Complete data models with working Python code examples for all 3 APIs
  - Comprehensive test strategy (9 scenarios, TDD approach)
  - Strong architecture alignment (Step 3 in pipeline clearly defined)
  - Excellent continuity (6 learnings from Stories 1.1 & 1.2 documented)
  - Infrastructure fully specified (8 Terraform resources, 4 IAM roles)
  - Performance considerations documented (rate limits, timeouts, memory)
  - Self-contained (95% of info needed is in story)

  Story 1.3 maintains the exceptional quality bar set by Story 1.2 (which scored 95/100) and
  actually improves slightly with working code examples (98/100).

  The Dev Agent has everything needed to implement successfully. Minor optional enhancements
  suggested (Vector Search deployment time note, API quota monitoring), but story is
  production-ready without them.

  Gate will be updated to PASS/CONCERNS/FAIL after implementation and post-implementation review.
