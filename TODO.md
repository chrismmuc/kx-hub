### Epic 4: Knowledge Graph with Entity and Relation Extraction

This epic focuses on building a comprehensive Knowledge Graph that integrates entity recognition and relationship extraction tools. This involves multiple interdependent stages and tasks:

- **Story 4.1**: Research and evaluate state-of-the-art relation extraction tools.
  - Status: Open
  - Owner: TBD
- **Planned Stages**:
  1. Implement entity recognition and ingestion pipeline.
  2. Integrate top-performing relation extraction tools.
    - Tools shortlisted for evaluation: SpaCy, OpenIE, [Add more].
  3. Validate the Knowledge Graph with sample datasets.

### Future Items
- Plan for scaling Knowledge Graph for larger datasets.
- Evaluate downstream applications like query answering.
