# Sprint Change Proposal

## 1. Identified Issue Summary

A strategic decision was made to pivot the technology stack from a multi-provider setup (AWS, OpenAI, Anthropic) to a unified Google Cloud and Vertex AI ecosystem. The primary driver for this change is to significantly reduce architectural complexity for the MVP, simplify MLOps, and leverage a more scalable, managed infrastructure from the outset.

## 2. Epic Impact Summary

No implementation (code) had commenced. Therefore, the impact on epics and stories is purely conceptual. All future epics and stories will be planned against the new Google Cloud-based architecture. No rework of existing stories is necessary.

## 3. Artifact Adjustment Needs

The following documents were affected:

*   **`docs/architecture.md`**: This document was completely rewritten to reflect the new Google Cloud and Vertex AI architecture. The previous version has been archived as `docs/architecture.md.old`.
*   **`docs/prd.md`**: This document was also completely rewritten to align with the new architecture. The previous version has been archived as `docs/prd.md.old`.

No other documents were identified as containing conflicting architectural details.

## 4. Recommended Path Forward

The chosen path was **Direct Adjustment / Integration**. The `architecture.md` and `prd.md` files have been updated to serve as the new source of truth for the project's technical design. All future development will proceed based on these new documents.

## 5. PRD MVP Impact

The core goals of the MVP remain unchanged. However, the implementation is now simpler and more scalable. The risk of technical overhead derailing the MVP has been significantly reduced.

## 6. High-Level Action Plan

1.  **Review & Approve**: User to review and approve the updated `docs/architecture.md`, `docs/prd.md`, and this Sprint Change Proposal.
2.  **Proceed with Development**: Begin development based on the new architecture.

## 7. Agent Handoff Plan

This change is now fully documented. The `Product Manager` (PM) has completed the course correction. The project can now be handed off to the `Architect` for any further detailed architectural specifications or to the `Developer` to begin implementation.
